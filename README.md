# Movie-Recommender-Systems
This repository contains code for building movie recommender systems using different approaches.

At some point of time, it is obvious that people would have wondered how the social media applications suggest them their new friends or how the e-commerce websites suggest them the similar products that they would possibly buy. These kind of personalized recommendations can be shown to the users by building the recommendation systems. In this project, we focus on building a recommendation system to suggest movies to the users based on the userâ€™s profile and its historical information. We are using the publicly available MovieLens dataset for this project. There are various aspects of a movie like popularity, genre, overview, etc. that can be used to make personalized recommendations to the user. In this work, we have implemented machine learning algorithms using content based filtering and collaborative filtering. We have also combined these algorithms to increase the accuracy of our predicted ratings and recommend a list of movies to the user.

For evaluating the models on predicting the ratings, we are using metrics like Root Mean Square Error(RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error(MAE). After the recommendation list is created, we evaluate the models based on metrics like Precision, Recall, F-meeasure and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain(NDCG) to measure the accuracy of recommendations by comparing to the test-data.
